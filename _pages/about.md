Hi! My name is Lavender Jiang (蒋遥). I am a third year Data Science PhD student at New York University, co-advised by [Eric Oermann](https://www.nyuolab.org/main/#team) and [Kyunghyun Cho](https://kyunghyuncho.me/). I work on natural language processing for clinical notes and I am interested in representation learning. I am a member with [OLAB](https://www.nyuolab.org/main/#home) and [ML2](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/). I am honored to be the receipient medical fellowship from [NYU Langone Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYU_Langone_Health) and the [AIML](https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/apple-scholars-aiml-2024) PhD fellowship from Apple. 

This summer (June-August 2024), I'll be interning at Apple Health Seattle :)

I received my BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mathematical Sciences from Carnegie Mellon, where I worked with [José Moura](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/) on [graph signal processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00468.pdf), [Pulkit Grover](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~pgrover/) on [cortical spreading detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9441333), and [Howard Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/) on sensor fusion. 

If you want to discuss research with me, feel free to write me an email. (If we know each other, we can [schedule](https://bit.ly/3lGo3UM) a 30-minute meeting). We can meet on Zoom or in person (Center for Data Science at 60 5th Ave, Tisch Hospital at 550 1st Ave, or Washington Square Park).

I enjoy cooking, gaming and yoga. I am married to my best friend [Xujin Liu](https://site.xujin.xyz/). Some of my new hobbies include rollerblading, pole dancing and bass guitar. I try (and sometimes fail) to live a vegan, low-waste and minimalist lifestyle.
